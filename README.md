# dotfiles

Well whatever this mess is, I hope no one notices it.  
This is just a repo for me to save my config (for when I redownload Ubuntu on a new laptop) so I dont have to think about what I have to config.

Also to store Pokemon Reborn save files for no apparent reasons other than personal wants

Maybe will port the ubuntu install script to MacOS, or to split them out for easier fix
